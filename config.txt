### List of supported instructions ###

MOV - Used to copy the byte or word from the provided source to the provided destination.
PUSH - Used to put a word at the top of the stack.
POP - Used to get a word from the top of the stack to the provided location.
XCHG - Used to exchange the data from two locations.
ADD - Used to add the provided byte to byte/word to word.
SUB - Used to subtract the byte from byte/word from word.
CMP - Used to compare 2 provided byte/word.
INC - Used to increment the provided byte/word by 1.
DEC - Used to decrement the provided byte/word by 1.
MUL - Used to multiply unsigned byte by byte/word by word.
DIV - Used to divide the unsigned word by byte or unsigned double word by word.
NOT - Used to invert each bit of a byte or word.
OR - Used to multiply each bit in a byte/word with the corresponding bit in another byte/word.
AND - Used for adding each bit in a byte/word with the corresponding bit in another byte/word.
XOR - Used to perform Exclusive-OR operation over each bit in a byte/word with the corresponding bit in another byte/word.
JUMP - Used to jump to the provided address to proceed to the next instruction.
JC - Used to jump if carry flag CF = 1
JNC - Used to jump if no carry flag (CF = 0)
JZ - Used to jump if zero flag ZF = 1
JNZ - Used to jump if not zero flag ZF = 0
JS - Used to jump if sign flag SF = 1
JNS - Used to jump if no sign flag SF = 0
STC - Used to set carry flag CF to 1
CLC - Used to clear/reset carry flag CF to 0
